<h1>About</h1>

<p class="lead">
    My name is Sean Conroy and I am a Junior at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I switched Majors from Computer
    Science to Information Systems in my Sophomore year because I was not thrilled with the content I was learning in
    Computer Science. Now being in Information Systems I enjoy the content I am learning much more and would like to
    continue with it into my career.I am looking to eventually build my own business after either working with a company
    designing websites, or working freelance to make enough money for a business. I want to one day open a restaurant to
    fulfill my father's dreams of owning one, hopefully before he passes.

    What I like to do on my free time is usually work on self-learning coding and playing video games. I don't work
    during the school year, which means I rarely leave my room during school. I try to get out as much as I can so I can
    maintain my health. I mainly just stick to my room and spend a good portion of the day playing video games, and then
    a smaller portion watching videos and practicing coding to attempt to teach myself new languages. I don't have a
    very active life, it's actually kind of boring. I enjoy what I do with my free time even if it seems to be boring to
    other people. I will worry about being more proactive with my free-time when I have less of it later on in life.

    The rest of this website contains information about previous projects that I have done, my resume, and my contact
    information. As I have said before, I do not have much experience, as I am trying to teach myself how to code
    basically. Most of the classes I have taken still have not taught me how to code properly. Therefore, I have to
    learn everything myself, making it take much longer. The projects I have listed were made specifically in this
    class, and nothing else. One day I will choose to update this website with more information about the projects I
    have completed.

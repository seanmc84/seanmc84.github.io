<h2>These were the requirements asked for Project 3</h2>

<div class="scroller">
    <p>For this mini project, you need to take your content from project 2 and recreate your project using Bootstrap and

        theme;
        however, you must build it piece by piece and show through your commits how you worked. IF you turn in a theme
        that
        is essentially just the uploaded theme you downloaded with only 2-3 commits that don't show your work, you will
